# Sportsclubmanagementsystem
A C program for managing sports club records
I recently worked on a Sports Club Management System using C language as part of my first-semester learning journey in engineering. This project was my attempt to automate that process using basic programming concepts. Through it, I got hands-on experience with structures, functions, menu-driven programs, and file handling in C. The system allows users to add, edit, delete, and view player records, manage court reservations, and securely store data using files, with a simple password-protected view for added security.



🔥 Key Highlights of My Project:



💾 Problem Solved: Automates court bookings, player records, and match schedules, avoiding errors and manual data loss.



🛠️ Programming Concepts Applied:



-> Structures to organize player and booking details

-> Functions for modular code and menu-driven operations

-> File handling (fopen, fprintf, fscanf, fclose) for permanent storage

-> Simple encryption for admin security



 💻 Core Features:



-> Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

-> Add, edit, delete, and view player and booking records

-> Court reservation checking to avoid double bookings

->🔑 Admin-only database view protected by password



📚 Learning Outcomes:



->💡 Implemented real-world problem-solving using C

->🐞 Improved debugging, file management, and logical thinking

->🤝 Gained experience in team collaboration and modular programming



🚀 Future Enhancements Ideas:



->👤 Member login system

->🏐 Court categorization by sport type

->⏳ Waitlist for fully booked courts

->✍️ Booking edits and quick search by phone number

->📝 Simple feedback system



🛠️ Tools & Environment:

->C Language, MinGW compiler, Visual Studio Code, Windows 11
